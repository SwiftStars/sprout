# Sprout Example Code
#

% projectname: My Swift
% cliname: myswift
% builtcli: .build/release/myswift
% giturl: https://github.com/SwiftStars/MySwift.git
% website: https://myswiftstuff.com/package

% build {

    swift build -c release

% }

# How this SproutFile Works:
#   Once Sprout finds this file, it seperates it line by line
#   into an Array that it decoded into a Dictionary containing
#   commands for how to run installation.
#
#   Lines 1-3 and 15-23 are ignored since comments (#) at the
#   begaining of a line mean ignored lines.
#   NOTE: Comments in the middle of a line are ignored.
#
#   Lines 5-7 provide details on this package, like the project's
#   name, it's name when using it on the command line, where the
#   fully built CLI is, the url used to clone the package's source
#   code, and the website for the package.
#
#   Lines 9-13 provide the steps required to build the package.
#   In this case, Sprout is being told to run a command, swift build
#   -c release, which builds the Swift package for release.
